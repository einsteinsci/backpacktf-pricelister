Advanced tools to aid in Steam Trading

##Projects
- **CustomSteamTools**: Class Library for checking various information useful for Steam and TF2 trading
- **Backpack.tf Console**: Console application focusing around the commands feature of CustomSteamTools
- **BumpTimer**: A 30-minute timer useful for a repetitive reminder to bump trades on TF2Outpost
- **TF2 Trading Toolkit**: A UI Application utilizing many different features of CustomSteamTools
- **Steam Attached Notifier**: A simple notifications-based app that sends notifications whenever you get a new trade offer or when someone you are trading with adds an item to the trading window, and looks up the bp.tf / market price. Still *VERY* WIP.
